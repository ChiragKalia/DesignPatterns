Hi All, In this project I'm using HEAD FIRST DESIGN PATTERN's chapter by chapter.

So,

1) CHAPTER1 project is based on the first chapter of HFDP's SimUDuck project. It's an introduction to design patterns.
2) CHAPTER2 project will be the implementation of HFDP's second chapter(Weather-O-Rama) based on observer pattern.
